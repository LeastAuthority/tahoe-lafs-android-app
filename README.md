Tahoe-LAFS - Android
==========

Tahoe-LAFS is a Free and Open decentralized cloud storage system. It
distributes your data across multiple servers. Even if some of the servers
fail or are taken over by an attacker, the entire file store continues to
function correctly, preserving your privacy and security.

This project is an Android client for the cloud file storage system.
